/**
 *              1383. Maximum Performance of a Team
 *
 *       You are given two integers n and k and two integer arrays speed and efficiency both of length n. There are n engineers numbered from 1 to n. speed[i] and efficiency[i] represent the speed and efficiency of the ith engineer respectively.
 *
 *       Choose at most k different engineers out of n engineers to form a team with the maximum performance.
 *       The performance of a team is the sum of their engineers' speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among their engineers.
 *
 *       Return the maximum performance of this team. Since the answer can be a huge number, return it modulo 109 + 7.
